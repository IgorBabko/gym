    <div class="Block__info">
        Here you can familiarize with different abilities of our website and you can read who our website made for.
        <br/>
        Our website is some kind of a personal web coach which contained a lot of information, calculators and practically everything you need for your training exercises and building a good body.
         Also, our website can provide you very nice and secure personal profile, which gives you a lot of additional functions and ability to enjoy your personal attainment in sport and your special goals, which you can set in your profile and monitor all the changes you’re getting during the training process.
        As additional option, our service can provide you forum function, where you can create your own story of changes and show it to your family after years, which you can download from you profile page in pdf format.
        If you don’t have an account here, don’t worry, its ok, you can enjoy our website, but some function will be not available for you, but you can fix it, just register yourself, and that’s it :)
        Also, our service can provide ability to test yourself, so you can check if your weight is ok, or if you’re eating enough of calories per day and stuff like that.
        A lot of different calculators are available too.
        So, create an account here for yourself and keep track your changes and make your own story every day.
        Good luck, guys, best regards! 
        Enjoy your life, and GYM will help you with it
